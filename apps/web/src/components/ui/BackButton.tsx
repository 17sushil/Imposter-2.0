/**
 * The one back button.
 *
 * It was drawn four times before this — a circle at a `clamp()` offset on the choice
 * screens, a circle at `left-0 top-0` in the room, a square with a different fill in
 * local setup — so the control moved and changed shape depending on which page you were
 * on. Now every screen renders this, so it lands in the same place at the same size with
 * the same colour, and the chrome no longer depends on each page's padding.
 *
 * Placement is `fixed`, not `absolute`: absolute resolves against whichever ancestor
 * happens to be `relative`, which is why the old buttons drifted between screens.
